# Todo List
## Define project scope and goals:
- [x] Write a one-page project proposal that outlines the project's objectives, features, and success criteria.
- [x] Create a prioritized list of project requirements and constraints.
- [x] Define the target audience for the project and conduct market research to identify their needs and pain points.
## Develop a project plan:
- [x] Break down the project into small, manageable tasks and estimate the time required to complete each task.
- [x] Create a Gantt chart or project timeline that outlines the project's major milestones and deadlines.
- [x] Identify and allocate the necessary resources (e.g., hardware, software, personnel) for the project.
## Gather necessary tools and resources:
- [x] Research and select the appropriate tools and resources for the project, such as programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and design software.
- [ ] Download and install the necessary software development kits (SDKs) and other tools.
- [ ] Set up a development environment that includes all the necessary hardware and software components.
## Design the user interface:
- [ ] Create a detailed wireframe or prototype of the user interface, using tools like Sketch or Figma.
- [ ] Conduct user testing and gather feedback on the design, making adjustments as necessary.
- [x] Create a style guide or design system that defines the visual and interaction design patterns for the project.
## Start coding:
- [ ] Write clean, well-documented code that follows best practices and coding standards.
- [ ] Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage changes and collaborate with others if necessary.
- [ ] Write automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) to ensure that the code works as intended.
## Test and debug:
- [ ] Use debugging tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to identify and fix issues in the code.
- [ ] Run automated tests regularly to catch any bugs or regressions.
- [ ] Conduct manual testing to ensure that the project works as expected across different platforms and devices.
## Deploy and launch:
- [ ] Set up a production environment and deploy the project to a web server or hosting provider.
- [ ] Conduct final testing and ensure that the project is secure, performant, and scalable.
- [ ] Announce the project launch and promote it through social media, email, and other channels.
## Maintain and update:
- [ ] Monitor the project for bugs, issues, and performance problems, and address them promptly.
- [ ] Gather feedback from users and make improvements to the project based on their suggestions.
- [ ] Stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices, and incorporate them into the project as appropriate.
