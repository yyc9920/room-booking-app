# Tools and Resources for Screen Golf Room Booking App Development

## Programming Languages and Frameworks

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces that provides a modern, declarative approach to building UI components. ReactJS will be used for the frontend development of the app.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows for server-side JavaScript execution. Node.js will be used for the backend development of the app.
- **ExpressJS**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. ExpressJS will be used as a middleware for Node.js backend.
- **TypeScript**: A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language, which can help catch errors before they occur. TypeScript will be used to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.

## Libraries

- **React Router**: A collection of navigational components that make it easy to route between views and URLs in a React application.
- **Material UI**: A set of React components that implement Google's Material Design guidelines, providing a modern and responsive UI for the app.
- **Socket.IO**: A JavaScript library for real-time web applications that enables bidirectional communication between client and server. Socket.IO will be used to handle real-time updates on booking changes.

## Database

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open source object-relational database system that provides robustness, scalability, and reliability. PostgreSQL will be used to store the booking and user data.

## Tools

- **Git**: A distributed version control system that provides collaboration and code management features. Git will be used for version control of the app's codebase.
- **JIRA**: A project management tool that provides issue tracking and agile project management features. JIRA will be used to track the progress and status of the project.

## Design Software

- **Figma**: A collaborative interface design tool that allows for prototyping, vector editing, and collaboration features. Figma will be used for designing the UI of the app.
